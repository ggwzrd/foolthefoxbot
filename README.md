### TWITTER BOT FOOLTHEFOX

## Reason to waist my time on this project

I used this project as a practice after the lesson on Typescript that I had at @Codaisseur on the 8th of June.

## Subject of the lesson

1. Building a simple API (not included in this project)
2. Getting used to **Interfaces**, **Type**
3. Exploring **Promises**
4. Last and more important point build a Twitter Bot to practice this roles
  1. In `src/fart2bot.ts` there's the code of a simple HTTP connection to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GiulioG_Me) with recursion used to fetch only the latest posts.
  2. In `src/fart2bot_stream.ts` there's the code for a stream connection to Twitter.


## FEEL FREE CLONE IT AND USE IT (FOR PRACTICE)
